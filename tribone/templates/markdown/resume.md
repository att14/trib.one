# Andrew Tribone [^H1]

Experienced technology leader with a proven track record of building and scaling high-performing engineering teams. Known for strategic planning, cross-functional collaboration, and effective project management. Equally strong in technical and business domains, with expertise in software development, architecture, and system design.

## Cortex

### Principal Software Engineer [^C1]

* Lead cross-functional teams in the planning, implementation, and deployment of multiple projects.
* Extended microservice catalog to include all types of infrastructure, e.g. databases and blob storage.
* Identified and optimized several inefficient query patterns created by Hibernate, in some case reducing the workload by 99%.
* Streamlined customer workflows by implementing automatic syncing of Cortex initiatives with Jira.

## X Delivery

### Distinguished Software Engineer [^X1]

* Technical lead and manager of the entire engineering and product department, including IT.
* Participated in executive meetings and planning.
* Designed and implemented an efficient cron-based ETL framework using Python to manage complex data pipelines. The system enabled seamless extraction and loading from various technologies, including Athena, SFTP, MongoDB, S3, Redshift, and others.
* Leveraged ETL framework to design and implement a high-performance data ingestion and API solution for parcel tracking. The system processed tens of millions of ingestion events per month, and powered our consumer-facing tracking page.
* Streamlined the tracking process by eliminating manual intervention. Previously, data was extracted from carriers, pieced together, and manually published to our database.
* Extended tracking ingestion to include webhook notifications, by pushing ingested tracking data to third-parties and customers.
* Scaled API application (Node.js & MongoDB) to handle over 1000% growth year-over-year.
* Migrated web server and database from EC2 to ElasticBeanstalk and MongoDB Atlas, respectively.
* Spearheaded the implementation of structured logging utilizing Logz.IO for requests and general application logs. By leveraging these logs, I developed comprehensive dashboards and monitoring systems to detect and prevent system failures and outages, proactively identifying and resolving issues before they impact customers or partners.
* Managed and implemented SOC II gap analysis and remediation, to ensure that the organization meets security and compliance requirements.
* Open-source contributions to `sqlalchemy-reshift`, `nock`, and `luxon-business-days`.
